# Project Name

The assignment this week was to build a chatbot, with the aim of practicing JavaScript and how it connects with HTML.

## The problem

I watched the videos, the code along, took notes and did practices. I talked to team mates and worked together both in Jitsi and irl. I was completely overwhelmed with the amount of information to take in and how to go about the task. I found it quite a disheartening process trying to build something from scratch when I didn't yet understand the basics, I found that approach to be extremely time consuming and it put me down never getting to feel I made progress. I tried to start the project several times during too many days, trying out too many approaches in my search for a way that would work for me. I had real trouble balancing the amount of work with my job and family life and will have to plan next week extremely well. In hindsight, I spent too much time trying to grasp the concept of javascript and the lingo before/as I tried building something. Not yet comfortable with copying code, not really knowing what is accepted and not, it took me six days before I instead tried tweaking an existing code, and that's when things started to fall into place. I'm happy I managed to hand in on time, unfortunately the bot isn't at all what I would like it to be. I still end this week on a positive note, feeling I've understood much more about how to go about future projects, I know how to work with others, we've come along way as a team. I look forward to making the inevitable change requests, now that I have a better understanding of what I'm doing! That is a great feeling, wanting to continue working on something to be better at it and feel the thrill of seeing the result â€“ not only to pass the assignment.
